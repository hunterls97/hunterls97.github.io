                <h2>ENG 2001 - Project Managment</h2>

                <p class="project-text"> During my second year at York University, I was enrolled in a project management 
                course where I had to participate in developing a project with a team of my colleagues.</p>

                <p class="project-text">The focus on this project was to incorporate good project management techniques to 
                a engineering project of our choosing, without actually executing the project. For our project, we chose to 
                host a theoretical design competition for students around the university. My role in this project was to 
                develop a website to handle advertisements and signup data for the competition.</p>

                <p class="project-text">Our project was well received, and our professor asked us to present it again on a 
                later date in front of a panel of other engineering professors.</p>
